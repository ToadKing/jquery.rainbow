		width:     Math.PI / 16,    // width of color bands
		speed:     Math.PI * 64,    // speed at which the colors change
		timeout:   50,              // milliseconds between each update, set low for smoothness
		redPos:    2 * Math.PI / 3, // position of the start of the red band, "high" for always full, or "low" for always 0
		greenPos:  0,               // position of the start of the green band, "high" for always full, or "low" for always 0
